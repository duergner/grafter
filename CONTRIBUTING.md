# Contributing to Grafter

We are happy to accept your contributions to make Grafter better and more awesome! 
To avoid unnecessary work on either side, please stick to the following process:

1. Check if there is already [an issue](https://github.com/zalando/grafter/issues) for your concern.
2. If there is not, open a new one to start a discussion. We hate to close finished PRs!
3. If we decide your concern needs code changes, we would be happy to accept a pull request.
4. Pull requests must always contain tests for the functionality implemented / fixed

In case you just want to help out and don't know where to start, [issues with "help wanted" label](https://github.com/zalando/grafter/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) are good for first-time contributors.

Unless you explicitly state otherwise in advance, any non trivial contribution intentionally submitted for
inclusion in this project by you to the steward of this repository (Zalando SE, Berlin) shall be 
under the terms and conditions of the [MIT License](README.md#license), without any additional copyright 
information, terms or conditions.
